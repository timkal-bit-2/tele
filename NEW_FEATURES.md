# New Features Documentation

## Overview
Three major features have been added to improve the teleprompter system:

1. **Profile Management System** (10 profiles with settings)
2. **Auto-Save Text Persistence** (never lose your text again)
3. **WebSocket Fallback System** (improved reliability)

---

## 1. Profile Management System

### What it does
- Save up to **10 named profiles** with all your settings
- Each profile remembers: fontSize, speed, padding, lineHeight, mirroring, reading line position, etc.
- Quick load/save with one click
- Edit profile names easily
- Auto-loads last used profile on startup

### How to use
1. **Create a profile:**
   - Adjust your settings (font size, speed, etc.)
   - Click the "‚ûï New" button in the Profiles section
   - Enter a name for your profile
   - Click "Create"

2. **Load a profile:**
   - Click the profile name button (blue)
   - All settings will be instantly applied

3. **Edit a profile name:**
   - Click the "‚úèÔ∏è" button next to the profile
   - Type the new name
   - Press Enter or click "Save"

4. **Delete a profile:**
   - Click the "üóëÔ∏è" button next to the profile
   - Confirm deletion

5. **Update a profile:**
   - Load the profile you want to update
   - Adjust your settings
   - Click "‚úèÔ∏è" and then "Save" to update

### Profile Information
- Location: Left sidebar under "üìã Profiles"
- Maximum profiles: 10
- Storage: Browser localStorage (persists between sessions)
- Each profile shows: font size, speed, and last update date

---

## 2. Auto-Save Text Persistence

### What it does
- **Automatically saves** your text content as you type
- Text is saved to localStorage every 1 second (debounced)
- Automatically **loads your last text** when you reload the page
- **No more Lorem Ipsum** on reload - your work is always preserved!
- Visual indicator shows when text is being saved

### Features
- üíæ **Auto-save indicator** shows "Saving..." then "‚úì Saved"
- **Survives page reloads** - your text is always there
- **Text history** - saves last 5 versions (for future undo feature)
- **Instant restore** on page load

### How it works
1. Type or edit your text in the editor
2. Watch for the "üíæ Saving..." indicator
3. When it shows "‚úì Saved", your text is securely saved
4. Reload the page - your text is automatically restored!

### Storage Location
- Primary storage: `localStorage['teleprompter-current-text']`
- History: `localStorage['teleprompter-text-history']`
- Last save time: `localStorage['teleprompter-last-save']`

## 3. WebSocket Fallback System

### What it does
Provides **multiple layers of reliability** to keep your Regie ‚Üî Ausspielung connection working:

1. **Multiple Server URLs** - tries different WebSocket servers if one fails
2. **Exponential Backoff** - smart retry strategy that doesn't overload servers
3. **localStorage Fallback** - when all WebSocket servers are down, uses browser storage to sync
4. **Connection Quality Monitoring** - tracks and displays connection health
5. **Auto-reconnect** - automatically tries to reconnect when disconnected

### Features

#### Multiple Server Fallback
- Primary server: Your Render.com WebSocket (from VITE_WS_URL)
- Backup server: Secondary Render.com instance
- Local fallback: localhost for development
- Automatically rotates through servers if one fails

#### Smart Reconnection
- **1st attempt:** 1 second delay
- **2nd attempt:** 2 seconds delay
- **3rd attempt:** 4 seconds delay
- **4th attempt:** 8 seconds delay
- **Max delay:** 30 seconds (with random jitter to prevent all clients reconnecting at once)

#### localStorage Sync Mode
When all WebSocket servers are unavailable:
- Automatically enables "üì± Fallback Mode"
- Uses browser localStorage to sync between Regie and Ausspielung tabs
- **Important:** Only works for tabs/windows in the SAME BROWSER on the SAME DEVICE
- **Does NOT sync between separate devices** (laptop ‚Üî iPad requires WebSocket server)
- Perfect for development or same-device testing
- For production: Use multiple Render instances or local server as backup

#### Connection Quality Indicator
Visual indicator shows connection health:
- **‚ö° (Green)** - Excellent (90%+ success rate)
- **‚úì (Blue)** - Good (70-90% success rate)
- **~ (Yellow)** - Fair (50-70% success rate)
- **! (Red)** - Poor (<50% success rate)

### How to use

#### Normal Operation
Just use the app normally! The fallback system works automatically in the background.

#### When Render.com is Down

**For Same-Device Operation:**
1. You'll see "üî¥ Getrennt" (Disconnected)
2. Then "üì± Fallback Mode" will appear
3. Your app continues working using localStorage sync
4. Open Regie and Ausspielung in **same browser** for localStorage sync to work
5. System will automatically try to reconnect to WebSocket servers

**For Cross-Device Operation (Laptop ‚Üî iPad):**
1. localStorage fallback **does NOT sync between devices**
2. **Best Solution:** Run local WebSocket server on laptop
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```
3. Connect iPad to laptop's local IP: `http://192.168.1.x:5173`
4. Or deploy multiple Render.com instances for redundancy
5. Or use iPad standalone mode (pre-load content, use touch controls)

#### Monitoring Connection
Watch the header for connection status:
- **üü¢ Verbunden** - Connected via WebSocket (best)
- **üü° Verbinde...** - Attempting connection
- **üî¥ Getrennt** - Disconnected
- **üì± Fallback Mode** - Using localStorage sync (working but degraded)
- **Connection Quality icon** - Shows historical reliability

### Technical Details

#### Fallback Strategy
```
1. Try primary WebSocket server
   ‚Üì (fails)
2. Try backup WebSocket server
   ‚Üì (fails)
3. Try localhost (if in development)
   ‚Üì (fails)
4. Enable localStorage sync fallback
   ‚Üì (keep retrying with exponential backoff)
5. Continue attempting reconnection indefinitely
```

#### localStorage Sync
- Polls every 500ms for changes
- Works between tabs in the same browser
- Limited to same device only (not cross-device)
- Automatically disabled when WebSocket reconnects

#### Connection History
- Tracks last 20 connection attempts
- Records success/failure for each server
- Sorts servers by reliability
- Helps optimize which server to try first

## Testing Checklist

### Profile Management
- [ ] Create a new profile with custom settings
- [ ] Load the profile - settings should apply
- [ ] Edit profile name
- [ ] Create 10 profiles (should hit maximum limit)
- [ ] Try to create 11th profile (should show error)
- [ ] Delete a profile
- [ ] Reload page - last used profile should load

### Text Persistence
- [ ] Type some text in editor
- [ ] Watch for "üíæ Saving..." indicator
- [ ] Wait for "‚úì Saved" indicator
- [ ] Reload page - text should be restored
- [ ] Edit text and reload again - latest changes should be preserved
- [ ] Clear browser cache - text history is lost (expected behavior)

### WebSocket Fallback
- [ ] Normal operation - should show "üü¢ Verbunden"
- [ ] Open browser console, see WebSocket messages
- [ ] Disconnect internet briefly - should auto-reconnect
- [ ] Force disconnect (close WebSocket server if running locally)
- [ ] Should show "üì± Fallback Mode"
- [ ] Open Regie and Ausspielung in same browser
- [ ] Changes should sync via localStorage
- [ ] Restore internet - should reconnect to WebSocket
- [ ] Check connection quality indicator after several uses

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can add multiple backup WebSocket servers by editing `src/utils/websocketFallback.js`:

```javascript
const FALLBACK_SERVERS = [
  import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL,           // Primary (from .env)
  'wss://backup-server.onrender.com/ws', // Add your backup server
  'ws://localhost:3002/ws'               // Local development
].filter(Boolean)
```

### Customization

#### Profile Settings (profileManager.js)
- Change `MAX_PROFILES` to allow more/fewer profiles
- Modify `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` to change default values

#### Text Auto-Save (textPersistence.js)
- Change `delay` parameter in `createDebouncedSave(1000)` for faster/slower saves
- Modify `MAX_HISTORY` for more/fewer history versions

#### WebSocket Retry (websocketFallback.js)
- Adjust `MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` (currently unlimited)
- Change `BASE_RECONNECT_DELAY` (currently 1 second)
- Modify `MAX_RECONNECT_DELAY` (currently 30 seconds)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Profiles not saving
- Check browser localStorage quota (usually 5-10MB)
- Try deleting old profiles
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Text not persisting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled in browser settings
- Try different browser if issue persists

### Fallback mode always active
- Check if `VITE_WS_URL` is set correctly in `.env`
- Verify WebSocket server is running
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Try manually visiting WebSocket URL to test connectivity

### Connection quality always poor
- This is expected for Render.com free tier (sleeps after inactivity)
- Consider upgrading to paid Render.com plan for better uptime
- localStorage fallback ensures app works even with poor connection

---

## Performance Notes

### localStorage Limits
- Maximum storage: ~5-10MB per domain (browser dependent)
- Each profile: ~500 bytes
- Text content: Size of your text (can be several KB)
- Consider exporting large texts to files

### WebSocket Performance
- Render.com free tier: may sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Heartbeat pings every 5 seconds keep server awake
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload during reconnection

### Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers supported (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- localStorage: IE8+
- WebSocket: All modern browsers
- Tested on latest Chrome and Safari

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Profile import/export (share profiles between devices)
- [ ] Text undo/redo using saved history
- [ ] Cloud backup for profiles and text
- [ ] WebRTC peer-to-peer connection as additional fallback
- [ ] Profile categories/folders
- [ ] Profile preview before loading
- [ ] Automatic profile switching based on content type
