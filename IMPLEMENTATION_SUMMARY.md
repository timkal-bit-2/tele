## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### No Environment Changes Required
All features work with existing setup! However, you can optionally:

1. **Add Backup WebSocket Server** (optional):
   - Deploy another instance on Render.com
   - Add URL to `src/utils/websocketFallback.js`
   - Provides redundancy if primary server fails

2. **Environment Variables** (existing):
   - `VITE_WS_URL` - Primary WebSocket server (already set)

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Deploy to Render.com (existing process)
git push  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

## üí° Usage Tips

### For Best Experience:
1. **Create profiles** for different scenarios (News, Scripts, Prompter)
2. **Name profiles descriptively** (e.g., "Large Font - Slow", "Mirror Mode")
3. **Monitor connection quality** to understand your network reliability
4. **Use fallback mode** when on unreliable networks
5. **Check NEW_FEATURES.md** for detailed feature explanations

### Performance Tips:
1. Keep text content under 100KB for best performance
2. Limit to 10 profiles to avoid clutter
3. Clear old text history if localStorage gets full
4. Close unused tabs to reduce localStorage polling

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### None! üéâ
All features tested and working as expected.

### Limitations (By Design):
1. **localStorage only** - No cross-device sync (by design)
2. **10 profile limit** - Prevents clutter (configurable)
3. **Render.com free tier sleeps** - Fallback mode handles this
4. **Same-device fallback** - localStorage sync requires same browser

---

## üìû Support

### If Issues Arise:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Review TESTING_GUIDE.md for troubleshooting
4. Check NEW_FEATURES.md for usage instructions
5. Report issues with console logs and reproduction steps
